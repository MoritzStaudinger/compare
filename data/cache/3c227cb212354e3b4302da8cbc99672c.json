{"summary": "Automated fact-checking is gaining importance due to the increasing volume of online false information and the limitations of manual fact-checking [1]. This field leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and big data mining to efficiently process large-scale textual information [1]. A key component of automated fact-checking is evidence retrieval, which involves finding relevant documents and snippets to challenge a claim [2]. Methods include snippet generation models, background knowledge retrieval, and reverse image search for multimedia content [2]. The goal is to save fact-checkers time and present evidence they might miss [2].\n\nAutomated verification approaches include checking against trusted sources, using machine learning to predict claim likelihood, and analyzing metadata [2]. A general-purpose framework for fully-automatic fact-checking uses a deep neural network with LSTM text encoding to combine semantic kernels with task-specific embeddings [3]. These embeddings encode a claim together with potentially relevant text fragments from the Web, while also considering source reliability [3]. The system converts claims into queries, retrieves relevant documents, and compares snippets and sentences from these documents to the claim [3].\n\nSeveral fact-checking datasets, pipelines, and models have been developed, supported by shared tasks like RumourEval, CLEF CheckThat!, ClaimBuster, FEVER, SCIVER, Fake News Challenge, and HeroX fact checking challenge [1]. These datasets and shared tasks are crucial for advancing research in the field.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Abumansour, A. S., et al. (2020).
